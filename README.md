# NYT-React-Search
React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application.  This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on searches.  I used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.
